# Classification-of-Mathematical-Symbols-using-SVM-and-ANN

The purpose of this project is to present and compare two different types of classifier models: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Both models are widely used in image classification tasks and have shown promising results. In this report, we focus on how these models perform when trained on three different types of image features: Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and raw pixel values.
To provide a comprehensive overview, this report first introduces the concept of image classification and explains the importance of feature extraction in this process. Then, we discuss the HOG, LBP, and raw pixel features in detail, highlighting their respective strengths and weaknesses. Next, we provide a brief overview of SVM and ANN classifiers and explain how they work in the context of image classification. Finally, we present the results of our experiments and analyse the performance of both models on each of the three types of image features.
